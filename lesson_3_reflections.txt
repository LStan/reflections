When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If you want to commit from different computers, or if you work in team

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    This way I'm able to deal only with stable versions of code

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    clone: copy of repository
    fork: copy of repository on GitHub(clone special)
    branch: different paths in repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can view last changes and logs without the Internet

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I'd use svn

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When I want to develop some new feature or fix some serious bug
