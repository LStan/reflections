How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It showed the differencies between to files, so bug was found quickly

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can fix regressions much easier

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: all commits convey a logical piece of information; you are able to be sure that
    commited code compiles
    cons: you can forget to commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because it is by design

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I can use git log to view log of all commits and git diff to see the difference between to commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You always can revert changes that introduced a bug

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to try using Git for finishing this course
